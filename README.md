### Tasks:
**Servo Heading Controller (due 9/12)**: Heading, or steering, is an important vehicle subsystem. Design a servo heading controller that will accept some sort of input and affect  the motor's heading accordingly. An accessible input device to use is a potentiometer. The controller (STM32, etc.) will convert the input into a PWM signal and the output state (motor heading) will reflect the input. This is an open-ended project. Use whichever resources, materials, and tools you need to complete this task. Please collaborate  with each other and ask questions if you need any help or advice.
